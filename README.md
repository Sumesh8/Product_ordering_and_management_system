## Introduction

Be introduced to my versatile Product Ordering and Management system, showcasing user-friendly admin and customer interfaces. This project encompasses a range of functionalities, including customer registration, product registration, handling of free issues and discounts, selection of flat or multiple options for free issues and discounts, placement of orders for customers, tracking of orders, and the capability to generate invoices in both bulk and individual formats. Invoices can be effortlessly created in PDF or CSV formats through the admin interface. Furthermore, the system provides insights into customer details, order history, and facilitates the generation of invoices for specific orders in bulk or individually. These invoices are available in both PDF and CSV formats for customer convenience.
